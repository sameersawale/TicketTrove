Ticket trove is a movie ticket booking app backend
Technologies used: Java, Spring boot, JPA, MySql, Maven, JWT authentication
Developed end to end backend application providing movie ticket booking.
In this application I used JWT authentication and authorization, so only Admin can add, update and delete
movie and theater data.
User can search nearby theaters, movies respective that theaters, see available seats for particular show
and book a ticket.
